# JavaScript Function with Subtle Null Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to null handling in functions. The `foo` function aims to add two numbers, but it has a weakness in handling potential runtime null or undefined values that are not explicitly checked.

## Bug Description

The provided JavaScript code correctly handles `null` values passed as arguments to the `foo` function. However, if the variables `a` or `b` are assigned values that resolve to `null` or `undefined` during runtime (e.g., from another function call or an object property that doesn't exist), the code will still throw a type error.  This is because the strict equality check (`===`) only checks for null, not for values that evaluate to null or undefined.

## Bug Solution

The improved function uses loose equality (`==`) to check for null or undefined values, ensuring that such values are handled gracefully.
